# Chrome Extension Architecture

Key components are listed below.

 - `public/background.js`: Has access to most chrome APIs, listens for invocations of the extension (click or keyboard shortcut).
 - `src/launcher.js`: Has access to the actual tab, some chrome APIs, injects scripts to page (live in a sandbox itself).
 - `src/toolkit.js`: This is the entry point for the meat of the extension. It has access to actual page's variables etc. and is a React app.

**Note:** See also [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9915311/chrome-extension-code-vs-content-scripts-vs-injected-scripts/9916089#9916089) for why there are three scripts involved with booting.

# React Architecture

Key components of the React app are listed below.

 - `toolkit.js`: Boots up the toolkit UI component, initializes Honeybadger and Fathom, manages communication with the chrome extension itself via `launcher.js` (which is sandboxed).
 - `components\StoreProvider.js`: Creates a context and provider for monitoring the Dynamics App State, using the reducer pattern. This polls for version numbers, form state, record Ids, etc. When one of these key values changes, it triggers a state update/repaint to all subscribers. This can trigger things like the `InfoCollectors` to reevaluate their dependent values.
